# PassionProject
This is the repo of my personal passion project.

## Core Project Statement
During this research competence, I will be researching the state of Flutter in 2019 as a cross-platform app development framework. I will be answering this topic based on a number of different criteria during the development process of an app called 'Checkr'. To learn more about Checkr, please scroll down to the 'Deliverables' section of this Readme.

At the end of this assignment, I would like to be able to answer the following questions:

1. Is it worth it to learn Dart solely for the purpose of using Flutter?
2. Is it really faster than other cross-application frameworks?
3. Is there enough community support / example code to the point where it can be your main programming language?
4. How easy is it to make and implement Flare animations in your Flutter project?
5. Would I reccomend it to other people that are using a similar framework such as React Native?

## Deliverables
To get answers on my researchquestions, I will be developing a cross-platform app called 'Checkr'.
Checkr will be a list-creating app that will cater to the more forgetful users that would like a list to check off. These lists will be used to check the content of something or to see if you didn't forget anything.
Some use cases would be: Packing, frequent items from the super market, content of a essay, the steps in writing a formal email, ...

These lists would be sharable and discoverable by using a search function to find other people's list. Other people can upvote your list, of which you would get a notification if you reach a surtent goal (20 upvotes for example). Another user can save that list so it will be easily accessible.

When a user completes a list, he would get positive feedback by seeing a smooth Flare animation.

I would like to explore the possibility of using a third party login service such as 'Log in with Google' for creating an account.


## Client
I don't really have a company or institution I'm developing this app for. The main target audience for this app would be forgetful people or someone that needs that little encouragement to complete a set of tasks. It would also be useful tool for students so they can easily track their progress and check if they have everything on an assignment.

## Planning
Week 1 (04/11). In this week, the design of the app should be done so that I have a clear vision what needs to be programmed.                 I also would like to run some tests with Flutter aswel as watch some Tutorials and read the docs of the                       Flutter framework.

week 2 (11/11). Week 2 = Front-end week! Learning the positioning, styling and interaction of widgets will be key this week. 

week 3 (18/11). Since there is another project going on during week 2, this week would be used to do the rest of the front-end
                work that is still left over. Idealy, I would also be doing some tests on the best way of writing a backend to
                save the lists in.

week 4 (25/11). In this week, making CRUD-operations to a database will be the main focus.

week 5 (02/12). In this week, I would like to perfect the backend of the app and look into implementing authentication. 

week 6 (09/12). Let's get moving! Creating and implementing Flare animations into the Flutter app will be my main objective
                this week.

week 7 (16/12). The final week will be used to perfect and stress-testing the application on all platforms. I would also like
                to add the possibility to change a saved list and save that changed list to your own account.

## Blog
I will be documenting my work and experiences with Flutter as I go on my Medium-blog labeled with PPP#.
